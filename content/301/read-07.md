An API is basically a user interface, but for a machine. 

There are universal methods that can be applied to many things. This is known as **polymorphism**. 

**http** uses a universal *get* method that is understood by all computers around the world. This allows all the machines to communicate to each other. 

Http can also add something to another web page by using a http **post** method. 

To replace something, http uses a **put** method. 

For a partial update, http uses a **patch** method.
