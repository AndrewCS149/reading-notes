# Graphs

### What is it?

A **Graph** is a data structure that is formed by connecting nodes with *edges* (line segments).

--- 

### Terminology

- Vertex - AKA node. Data object that has zero or more vertices
- Edge - The line segment that connects two vertices 
- Neighbor - A vertex's adjacent vertices.
- Degree - Total amount of edge that are connected to one vertex.

### Directed and Undirected

A **directed** graph means that the vertices are connected in a direction. An **undirected** graph is the opposite where an edge is bi-directional.

### Types of Graphs 

- Completed - All vertices are connected to all vertices
- Connected - Vertices have one or more edge
- Disconnected - One or more vertex has no edges
