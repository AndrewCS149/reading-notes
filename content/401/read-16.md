### BootStrap

**BootStrap** is a CSS framework that allows users to create responsive web designs with ease. This is achieved by having pre built web components. It is all based on a grid system and is uses a mobile first approach, so everything will work seamlessly between phones and desktops. 

The grid system uses a system of five different tiers.
