# Dependency Injection & Repository Design Pattern

### Dependency Injection

A **dependency** is an object that requires another object in order to function.

To *inject a dependency* simply means to *inject* that dependency from *outside* the class.

### Repository Design Pattern

The *repository pattern* is a way to focus domain object handling and provide a layer of abstraction to the data.

### SOLID

The SOLID principles: 

- S - Single Responsibility
  - A class should have one responsibility
- O - Open / Close
  - Classes should be able to be extended in functionality, but not in modification 
- L - Liskov Substitution
- I - Interface Segregation
  - Users should not have to use methods that they do not need
- D - Dependency Inversion
