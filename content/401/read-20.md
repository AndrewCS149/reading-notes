# Hash Tables

### What is a hash table?

Let's break it down in term:

**Hash** - A hash is a result of an algorithm that takes in a string and converts it into some kind of value that is used for security reasons, or, an index. 

**Buckets** - A bucket is the values that are contained in each index position of the array within the hashtable. If a *collision* occurs at a specific index, then that bucket will have more than one value. 

**Collisions** - Collisions occur when two or more than one key is positioned at the same index position.

### Use Cases

Hash tables are excellent to hold key value pairs in large sums.
