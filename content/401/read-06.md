# OOP Principles

## One concept that is more clear to me then when it was originally introduced.

Unit Testing:

Before starting 401 ASP.NET, I did not have a clue in the slightest what unit testing was. After day one of unit testing, it was still unclear on how it was actually confirming the success of methods. I also did not have a firm understanding on how to create 'passing invalid unit tests'. This did not make much sense to me. 

I now have a much better understanding of what unit testing is and what it accomplishes. I confident that in the duration of this course, writing unit tests will be of second nature to me.
