# Teamwork

#### TeamWork

Before attending Code Fellows, I attended a college for two quarters for computer science. Out of the four programming classes, I only had ONE group project. This caused countless amounts of skill regression:

- Could not learn from others
- Did not help communication skills
- Classmates did not have chit chat
- etc etc

Team environments benefit both the company and the workers in various ways:

- invoke creative ideas
- promote a healthy work life
- create friendships
- maximize time efficiency
- networking opportunities
- much more

Companies today are realizing that teamwork mentalities go much farther than individual talent, which is why they are promoting team environments instead of focusing on specific individuals.

Google specifically worked on creating a perfect team. They named this project "Project Aristotle". This project was to analyze EVERYTHING about hundreds of different employees to conclude what would make a perfect team. It was still nearly impossible to find a specific pattern that lead to a teams success.

It boils down to a few different things. Google found that teams that treated every single member with general respect and allowed everyone to speak there thought and ideas were the most successful. Creating this vulnerable environment to allow all team members the freedom to give their thought without the fear of being criticized.
